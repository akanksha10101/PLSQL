ðŸ”¹ What is PL/SQL?

          PL/SQL stands for Procedural Language / Structured Query Language.
          It is Oracleâ€™s extension of SQL designed for developers working with the Oracle Database.
          Combines procedural programming features (like loops, IF statements) with SQL for database manipulation.
          Allows writing blocks of code that can include variables, conditions, loops, and SQL statements.


ðŸ”¹ Role in the Technology Stack

Applications are built using a stack of technologies:

            Top layer: Presentation layer (user interface) â€” e.g., Java.
            Middle layer: Database software (stores and manipulates data).
            Bottom layer: Operating system and hardware interaction.

SQL is used to manipulate data in relational databases.
PL/SQL extends SQL to support full business logic and application functionality.

ðŸ”¹ Why PL/SQL?

              Extends SQLâ€™s capabilities with procedural logic (e.g., IF-THEN, loops).
              Provides tight integration with SQL, enabling complex database operations.
              Offers better performance by reducing network traffic between applications and the database.
              Enhances portability â€” PL/SQL programs can run on any Oracle Database instance.
               Improves maintainability of applications that use both SQL and PL/SQL.
